# 🌤 Weather Forecasting Dashboard

An interactive Weather Forecasting Dashboard built to visualize real-time weather trends, air quality index, and environmental indicators using structured dataset from a weather forecasting website.

# 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a responsive and analytical weather dashboard that displays:

- Current Temperature
- 7-Day Forecast
- Air Quality Index (AQI)
- Wind Speed
- Humidity
- Pressure
- UV Index
- Precipitation
- Sunrise & Sunset Time
- Pollutant Breakdown (O3, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, EPA)

The dashboard is designed to transform raw weather dataset into meaningful visual insights.
